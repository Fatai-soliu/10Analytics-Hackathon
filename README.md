Unraveling the Challenges of Unemployment in Africa: A Data-Driven Approach

# Insight and Recommendation

## Introduction

In the complex landscape of Africa's economic development, one pressing issue continues to demand attention: unemployment. The challenges surrounding employment opportunities in Africa are multifaceted, impacting communities, economies, and the aspirations of millions. In this presentation, I will delve into the intricate layers of this issue, examining its root causes with my visualization, and current trends, and proposing data driven insights and recommendations aimed at fostering sustainable solutions. My insights aim to shed light on the complexities of unemployment in Africa and pave the way towards a more prosperous and inclusive future.

## Unemployment Rate and Gender

Africa's average unemployment rate stands at 21.10%. Lesotho holds the highest rate at 47.96%, while Rwanda has the lowest at 2.29%.
Females represent the highest portion of unemployment in Africa at 11.22%, constituting 53.17% of the Total Unemployment rate.
An inverse relationship between adult population and unemployment persists in many African countries, indicating ongoing unemployment despite larger populations.

## Unemployment and Government Expenditure in Education

Africa's average government expenditure on education  over the years (1980-2021) is 14.53%, ranging from Tunisia's high of 24.22% to Somalia's low of 2.93%.

## Population with Access to Electricity and Unemployment Rate

There's a rising trend in the percentage of people with access to electricity in Africa between the year 1990 - 2020.
The correlation between access to electricity and unemployment rate reveals notable instances (Algeria, Tunisia, Gabon) where high access to electricity aligns with high unemployment, signaling resource underutilization.

## Availability of Firms and Unemployment

Africa's average business density rate is 53.38%.
A weak indirect correlation exists between business density rate and high unemployment. Most countries with high unemployment have low business density, barring Botswana, which exhibits exceptionally high business density despite its unemployment rate.


# Recommendation

## Targeted Employment Programs for Gender Equity

  - Create targeted skill-building programs and support networks to enhance female workforce participation.
  -  Collaborate with public and private sectors to promote gender diversity in job opportunities

## Enhance Education Spending for Employability

- Allocate increased resources towards education in countries with lower government expenditure (e.g., Somalia), emphasizing skill-oriented training to match job market demands.
- Encourage public-private partnerships to develop tailored educational programs that align with industry needs.

## Optimize Resource Utilization for Employment Growth

- Implement policies aimed at utilizing available resources (like electricity) to foster economic growth and create employment opportunities
- Conduct targeted studies to identify barriers hindering resource utilization in high-access regions and devise strategies to overcome them


## Stimulate Business Development for Job Creation

- Promote entrepreneurship and facilitate the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to increase business density.
- Offer incentives and support programs for budding entrepreneurs, especially in regions with high unemployment and low business density.
Foster an enabling environment through regulatory reforms and access to finance to encourage business growth and job creation.

# Limitation of Data

Due to limited data up to 2015, a comprehensive analysis of how factors like access to power, government spending, and business density influence unemployment trends over time isn't feasible. Nevertheless, I've showcased the trend patterns of these variables and conducted a comparative analysis of unemployment rates across African countries.
